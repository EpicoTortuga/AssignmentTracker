This widget requires some personalized code at the beginning that will allow it to properly manage your classes. This step may be a little tedious, but it is extremely important, so pay close attention to the provided directions. Use the generator and these instructions to produce your code!

A video version of these directions is provided here.

# Directions
1. First, copy the generator document. Make sure you have Canvas opened in another tab.

2. Before you do anything, the scripts running behind this generator must be authenticated. Do do this, click on any button on the document, and wait for the notification that asks for authentication. This will take a few seconds.

3. Click on the "Continue" button, then on the next page, click "Advanced," then "Co to Assignment Checker Code Generator." Select your account, then click "Allow."    
   
**NOTE:** This script is NOT capable of accessing any of your data outside of this one spreadsheet. If you would like to review the code that you are accepting, you can navigate to "Help," then type "Script Editor" in the search box. If you still do not feel comfortable using this spreadsheet, please contact me on my Instagram: @ben.tastic_

4. Next, you will begin to enter information about your class periods. In the "Add Class Period" section, fill in the boxes with information about your classes. The order in which you enter information here will be used in the widget, so be sure you add your classes in your desired order. You may enter any name in the "Name" box, but make sure the Link box has a link to the main home page of each class. If you would like to manually select your colors, enter a hex code for each color in the "Color" box. If you do not want to do this leave it blank and your colors will be selected for you automatically, for up to ten classes.

5. Once you finish adding an entry for each class, now your must enter you "Auth Token." To get your auth token, navigate to your settings page on Canvas. Scroll to "Approved Integrations," and click "New Access Token." You may type whatever you like for the token's purpose, but make sure it does not expire. After creating the token, copy and paste it into the "Auth Token" box on the spreadsheet.

6. You are finished entering your information! Finally, click the "Generate" button on the spreadsheet. Your code will be generated in the large box to the bottom left. Save this code for later - you will need it for the widget.
