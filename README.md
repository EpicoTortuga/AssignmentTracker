# Canvas Assignment Tracker
Tired of the Canvas mobile app? This widget will display all of your upcoming assignments in a sleek, readable fashion. 

Only requires one setup - then it will work in the background with no extra user input required.

# Setup Guide

1. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1ML6tQHWNvEXuhORX2N_TMJwtaVBaPAdpejnXwAyiU/edit?usp=sharing) to generate your personal code.

2. If you don't have it already, download the "Scriptable" app from the App Store.

3. Create a new script.

4. Copy all of the code on [this page](https://github.com/EpicoTortuga/AssignmentTracker/blob/main/WidgetCode), and paste it into your new script.

5. Replace the marked section at the top of the script with the code you generated earlier.

6. You're done! Now you can add a large widget to your home screen and the rest of the work will be done for you.
